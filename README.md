MCWeb is a Ruby-based Web frontend for viewing the status and vital info of multiple Minecraft SMP servers running on a single physical machine. Simply configure MCWeb with the root directory of the server installations and launch it as a Sinatra webapp.

MCWeb attempts to detect Minecraft servers running on its host machine; see the [MCWeb wiki](https://github.com/PneumatiCraft/MCWeb/wiki) for more information and configuration help.
